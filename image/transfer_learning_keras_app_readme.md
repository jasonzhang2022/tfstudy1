1. This example uses keras.application instead of hub module. Image caption with attention model also use keras 
   application to extract feature from image
1. It uses tfds.dataset
   1. It demos how one use split.
   1. How one read meta information from the dataset. 
   1. Again, it uses tf.image package to process image(cast, resize, feature scaling and normalization)
